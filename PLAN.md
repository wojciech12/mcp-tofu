# MCP Server for OpenTofu - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the iterative approach to implementing a Model Control Plane (MCP) server for OpenTofu, supporting the essential commands: init, validate, plan, apply, and destroy.

## Project Overview

We're building an MCP server that will interface with OpenTofu, providing a structured API to execute and manage infrastructure as code commands. This implementation will follow MCP standards and provide a robust interface for OpenTofu operations.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup and Configuration
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Create configuration models using Pydantic
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling utilities
- [ ] Setup basic MCP server structure

### 1.2 OpenTofu Integration Foundations
- [ ] Create OpenTofu command execution service
- [ ] Implement command output parsing utilities
- [ ] Design models for OpenTofu command inputs and outputs
- [ ] Create basic testing fixtures

## Phase 2: Command Implementation - Init & Validate (Week 2)

### 2.1 Init Command
- [ ] Define models for Init command input/output
- [ ] Implement Init command execution service
- [ ] Add error handling for common Init failures
- [ ] Write unit tests for Init command

### 2.2 Validate Command
- [ ] Define models for Validate command input/output
- [ ] Implement Validate command execution service
- [ ] Parse and structure validation results
- [ ] Write unit tests for Validate command
- [ ] Integration tests for Init + Validate workflow

## Phase 3: Command Implementation - Plan (Week 3)

### 3.1 Plan Command Core
- [ ] Define comprehensive models for Plan command input/output
- [ ] Implement Plan command execution service
- [ ] Parse and structure plan outputs (resources to add/change/destroy)

### 3.2 Plan Analysis
- [ ] Implement plan difference analysis tools
- [ ] Create visualization/formatting utilities for plan outputs
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for Plan command

## Phase 4: Command Implementation - Apply (Week 4)

### 4.1 Apply Command
- [ ] Define models for Apply command input/output
- [ ] Implement Apply command execution service with proper status tracking
- [ ] Handle approval workflows and apply timeouts
- [ ] Write unit tests for Apply command

### 4.2 State Management
- [ ] Implement state file parsing and management
- [ ] Create state comparison utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for Plan + Apply workflow

## Phase 5: Command Implementation - Destroy (Week 5)

### 5.1 Destroy Command
- [ ] Define models for Destroy command input/output
- [ ] Implement Destroy command execution service
- [ ] Add safety mechanisms and confirmation workflows
- [ ] Write unit tests for Destroy command

### 5.2 Final Integration
- [ ] End-to-end testing for complete workflows
- [ ] Performance optimization for large infrastructures
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Implementation Details

### Models Structure
- `models/config.py` - Configuration models
- `models/commands/` - Command-specific input/output models
- `models/state.py` - OpenTofu state representation models

### Services Structure
- `services/tofu_executor.py` - Core command execution service
- `services/commands/` - Command-specific implementation services
- `services/parser.py` - Output parsing services

### API Structure
- `api/router.py` - API routes definition
- `api/endpoints/` - Command-specific endpoint implementations

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each command implementation
2. Integration tests for command sequences
3. Mock testing for OpenTofu execution
4. End-to-end tests with real OpenTofu operations on safe resources

## Iterative Delivery
Each phase will follow this process:
1. Design models and interfaces
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement command functionality
4. Pass tests and refactor
5. Document and review before proceeding to next phase
