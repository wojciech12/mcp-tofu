# MCP Server for OpenTofu - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the iterative development plan for implementing the OpenTofu MCP server. We will implement one command at a time, following our test-driven development workflow.

## Phase 0: Project Setup and Scaffolding
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Configure dependencies in pyproject.toml
3. Create server skeleton with FastAPI
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement health check endpoint

## Phase 1: Command - `init`
1. Write failing tests for `init` command
   - Test request validation
   - Test command execution
   - Test response formatting
2. Create function stubs with proper typing
3. Define Pydantic models for request/response
4. Implement service layer for OpenTofu init execution
5. Create API endpoint
6. Document implementation in docs.md

## Phase 2: Command - `plan`
1. Write failing tests for `plan` command
   - Test request validation
   - Test command execution
   - Test response formatting
2. Create function stubs with proper typing
3. Define Pydantic models for request/response
4. Implement service layer for OpenTofu plan execution
5. Create API endpoint
6. Document implementation in docs.md

## Phase 3: Command - `apply`
1. Write failing tests for `apply` command
   - Test request validation
   - Test command execution
   - Test response formatting
2. Create function stubs with proper typing
3. Define Pydantic models for request/response
4. Implement service layer for OpenTofu apply execution
5. Create API endpoint
6. Document implementation in docs.md

## Phase 4: Command - `destroy`
1. Write failing tests for `destroy` command
   - Test request validation
   - Test command execution
   - Test response formatting
2. Create function stubs with proper typing
3. Define Pydantic models for request/response
4. Implement service layer for OpenTofu destroy execution
5. Create API endpoint
6. Document implementation in docs.md

## Phase 5: Integration and Refinement
1. Implement error handling across all commands
2. Create integration tests for command workflows
3. Add logging and observability
4. Optimize performance where needed
5. Update documentation

## Development Guidelines
- Each phase will follow the test-driven development workflow
- After each phase completion, run full test suite, type checking, and linting
- Request approval before proceeding to next phase
- All code changes must be documented in docs.md
- All new functionality must include appropriate tests
