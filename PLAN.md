# MCP Server for OpenTofu - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for OpenTofu using **fastmcp v2**. The implementation will follow an iterative approach, starting with a hello-world example and then adding support for the core OpenTofu commands sequentially.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create a DevOps-focused MCP server that facilitates interactions with OpenTofu while providing quick access to infrastructure-as-code best practices. The server will provide a structured interface for AI models to interact with OpenTofu operations and embed DevOps best practices throughout the workflow.

**Key Features:**

- FastMCP v2 based implementation (following patterns from atproto_mcp example)
- Integration with context7 MCP for accessing newest OpenTofu documentation
- DevOps best practices embedded in each command
- Structured interface for AI model interactions

We'll implement support for the main OpenTofu commands:

1. `init` - Prepare working directory for other commands
2. `validate` - Check whether the configuration is valid
3. `plan` - Show changes required by the current configuration
4. `apply` - Create or update infrastructure
5. `destroy` - Destroy previously-created infrastructure

## Current Project Structure

The project has a basic structure with the following components:

- Basic project configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Directory structure for MCP implementation (mcp/, with subdirectories for api, config, models, services, utils)
- Development guidelines (CLAUDE.md)
