# Implementation Plan: MCP for OpenTofu

This document outlines our iterative approach to implementing Model Control Plane (MCP) support for OpenTofu. We will implement the core OpenTofu commands sequentially: `init`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.

## Project Setup and Initial Structure

### Phase 0: Project Scaffolding
- Set up project structure with proper packaging
- Configure development tools (ruff, pyright, pre-commit)
- Establish base MCP server implementation
- Create initial test framework
- Add documentation skeleton

## Iterative Implementation

### Phase 1: OpenTofu `init` Support
**Goal**: Implement support for the `init` command to prepare working directories.

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Create OpenTofu client wrapper
   - Implement directory structure management
   - Design data models for init configuration
   - Support module installation
   - Handle backend configuration

2. **Error Handling**
   - Provider not found
   - Invalid configuration syntax
   - Backend initialization failures
   - Permission issues

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for init functionality
   - Integration tests with simple configurations
   - Error case coverage

### Phase 2: OpenTofu `validate` Support
**Goal**: Implement configuration validation functionality.

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Parse and validate configuration files
   - Check resource references
   - Validate provider configurations
   - Report validation errors

2. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid syntax
   - Missing required attributes
   - Invalid references
   - Provider configuration errors

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for validation logic
   - Test cases for common configuration errors
   - Test report formatting

### Phase 3: OpenTofu `plan` Support
**Goal**: Implement plan generation to show required changes.

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Generate execution plans
   - Detect changes to resources
   - Format plan output
   - Support plan file generation
   - Handle variables and input values

2. **Error Handling**
   - Configuration errors
   - Provider errors during plan generation
   - State file issues
   - Variable resolution problems

3. **Testing**
   - Plan generation with various resource types
   - Change detection accuracy
   - Plan output formatting
   - Variable handling

### Phase 4: OpenTofu `apply` Support
**Goal**: Implement infrastructure creation and updates.

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Execute planned changes
   - Update state
   - Handle resource dependencies
   - Support approval workflows
   - Implement state locking

2. **Error Handling**
   - Resource creation failures
   - Dependency resolution issues
   - State conflicts
   - Partial apply scenarios

3. **Testing**
   - Resource creation tests
   - Update scenarios
   - Dependency resolution
   - State management
   - Error recovery

### Phase 5: OpenTofu `destroy` Support
**Goal**: Implement infrastructure destruction.

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Generate destroy plans
   - Execute resource deletion
   - Handle deletion order
   - Update state after destruction

2. **Error Handling**
   - Deletion failures
   - Dependency issues during deletion
   - Protected resources
   - Partial destroy scenarios

3. **Testing**
   - Resource deletion order
   - State updates after destruction
   - Protected resource handling
   - Error scenarios

## Integration and Refinement

### Phase 6: Integration and Polish
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- User experience improvements
- Edge case handling

## Implementation Schedule

| Phase | Focus | Estimated Duration |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 0 | Project Scaffolding | 1 week |
| 1 | `init` Command | 2 weeks |
| 2 | `validate` Command | 2 weeks |
| 3 | `plan` Command | 3 weeks |
| 4 | `apply` Command | 3 weeks |
| 5 | `destroy` Command | 2 weeks |
| 6 | Integration & Polish | 2 weeks |

## Success Metrics

For each phase, we will measure success by:
1. All tests passing with good coverage
2. Compatibility with official OpenTofu CLI
3. Proper error handling and reporting
4. Documentation completeness
5. Type checking passing with no errors

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| OpenTofu API changes | High | Monitor releases, maintain version compatibility |
| Performance issues with large configurations | Medium | Implement progressive loading, benchmark early |
| Complex state management | High | Thorough testing, follow established patterns |
| Security concerns | High | Follow least-privilege principle, secure credential handling |

This plan will be revisited and refined at the completion of each phase to incorporate lessons learned and adjust for any changing requirements.
